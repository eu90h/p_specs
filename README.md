This repository contains formal specifications of programs written in [P](https://p-org.github.io/P/), a language specifically intended for formal modeling and analysis of distributed systems that aims to make specification more accessible than, say, TLA+, while also aiming to alleviate combinatorial explosion of model state spaces.

For more on how to get started with P, [click here](https://p-org.github.io/P/getstarted/install/).

`Common/FailureInjector`, `Common/Timer`, and `Common/SharedMemory` were written by contributors to the P language and are included in the [tutorial tree](https://github.com/p-org/P/tree/master/Tutorial) of the language repository.
